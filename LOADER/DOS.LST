        data is written beginning at the current file position, and the file    
          position is updated after a successful write                          
        the usual cause for AX < CX on return is a full disk                    
BUG:    a write of zero bytes will appear to succeed when it actually failed    
          if the write is extending the file and there is not enough disk       
          space for the expanded file (DOS 5.0-6.0); one should therefore check 
          whether the file was in fact extended by seeking to 0 bytes from      
          the end of the file (INT 21/AX=4202h/CX=0/DX=0)                       
        under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX

            AX = error code (01h,06h) (see #0885 at AH=59h)                     
Notes:  for origins 01h and 02h, the pointer may be positioned before the       
          start of the file; no error is returned in that case, but subsequent  
          attempts at I/O will produce errors                                   
        if the new position is beyond the current end of file, the file will    
          be extended by the next write (see AH=40h)                            
BUG:    using this method to grow a file from zero bytes to a very large size   
          can corrupt the FAT in some versions of DOS; the file should first    
          be grown from zero to one byte and then to the desired large size
